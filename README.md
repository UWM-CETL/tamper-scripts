UWM CETL Userscripts üñáÔ∏è

Tiny bits of JavaScript that run **in your browser** and make Canvas and other academic tools less painful.  All scripts live in `/scripts`. Install only the ones you need.

## Why userscripts?
* **Zero-install for IT** ‚Äì they run in your own browser profile, no campus-wide rollout.
* **Instant iteration** ‚Äì copy a file ‚Üí refresh the page ‚Üí done.
* **Open source** ‚Äì every line is visible; nothing is phoning home.

## Requirements
To use these scripts, install a userscript runner extension in your browser. Popular scriptrunners include:

* [Greasemonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
* [Tampermonkey for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Others (Preferred)](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

Snippets should work with other userscript runners as long as they provide the same API.
