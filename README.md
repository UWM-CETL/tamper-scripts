UWM CETL Userscripts 🖇️

Tiny bits of JavaScript that run **in your browser** and make Canvas and other academic tools less painful.  
All scripts live in `/scripts`. Install only the ones you need.

## Why userscripts?
* **Zero-install for IT** – they run in your own browser profile, no campus-wide rollout.
* **Instant iteration** – copy a file → refresh the page → done.
* **Open source** – every line is visible; nothing is phoning home.

## Requirements

**Violentmonkey** - ✨ Recommended – no ads, open-source MIT license.

Snippets should work with other tools like Greasemonkey 4, Tampermonkey, and others.

## Quick-start (60 seconds)

1. **Install a manager**  
   * Chrome / Edge → <https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey>  
   * Firefox          → <https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/>

2. **Grab a script**  
   * Navigate to the `scripts` folder in this repo.  
   * Click the file you want (e.g. **Canvas-Export-Grades-With-Email.user.js**).  
   * Hit **Raw** – your manager will pop up “Install?”

3. **Click “Confirm”** → refresh Canvas → new button / feature appears.
